            <ul style="color: darkorange" >
            <li>India never invaded any country in her last 10000 years of history. </li>
            <li>According to the Gemological Institute of America, up until 1896, India was the only source for diamonds to the world. </li>
            <li>When many cultures were only nomadic forest dwellers over 5000 years ago, Indians established Harappan culture in Sindhu Valley (Indus Valley Civilization)</li>
            <li>The art of Navigation was born in the river Sindh 6000 years ago. The very word Navigation is derived from
                the Sanskrit word NAVGATIH. The word navy is also derived from Sanskrit 'Nou'.</li>
            <li>The value of pi was first calculated by Budhayana, and he explained the concept of what is known as the Pythagorean Theorem.
                He discovered this in the 6th century long before the European mathematicians. </li>
            <li>USA based IEEE has proved what has been a century-old suspicion in the world scientific community that
                the pioneer of Wireless communication was Prof. Jagdeesh Bose and not Marconi. </li>

    <p class="text" style="cursor: crosshair;">
        The Indian subcontinent, the great landmass of South Asia, is the home o one of the world’s oldest and most influential civilizations. In this article, the subcontinent, which for historical purposes is usually called
        simply “India,” is understood to comprise the areas of not only the present-day Republic of India but also the
        republics of Pakistan (partitioned from India in 1947) and Bangladesh (which formed the eastern part of Pakistan
        until its independence in 1971). For the histories of these latter two countries since their creation, see Pakis
        tan and Bangladesh.

        Since early times the Indian subcontinent appears to have provided an attractive habitat for human occupation.
        Toward the south it is effectively sheltered by wide expanses of ocean, which tended to isolate it culturally in
        ancient times, while to the north it is protected by the massive ranges of the Himalayas, which also sheltered it
        from the Arctic winds and the air currents of Central Asia. Only in the northwest and northeast is there easier
        access by land, and it was through those two sectors that most of the early contacts with the outside world took place.

        Within the framework of hills and mountains represented by the Indo-Iranian borderlands on the west, the Indo-Myanmar
        borderlands in the east, and the Himalayas to the north, the subcontinent may in broadest terms be divided into two major
        divisions: in the north, the basins of the Indus and Ganges (Ganga) rivers (the Indo-Gangetic Plain) and, to the south,
        the block of Archean rocks that forms the Deccan plateau region. The expansive alluvial plain of the<img src="front.jpg" height="163" width="310"/> river basins provided
        the environment and focus for the rise of two great phases of city life: the civilization of the Indus valley, known as the
        Indus civilization, during the 3rd millennium BCE; and, during the 1st millennium BCE, that of the Ganges.
        To the south of this zone, and separating it from the peninsula proper, is a belt of hills and forests, running generally
        from west to east and to this day largely inhabited by tribal people. This belt has played mainly a negative role throughout
        Indian history in that it remained relatively thinly populated and did not form the focal point of any of the principal regional
        cultural developments of South Asia. However, it is traversed by various routes linking the more-attractive areas north and south of it.
        The Narmada (Narbada) River flows through this belt toward the west, mostly along the Vindhya Range,
        which has long been regarded as the symbolic boundary between northern and southern India.
